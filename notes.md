# C
- Its actually a pretty simple language
- Pointers
- Pass by value, pass by pointer
- Arrays are pointers
- Stack vs Heap
- C standard library

# Make
- Rules
- Try to keep it simple
- Complexity of build systems, none are really good, make might be least bad

# Linux
- Not too much you need to know for the class, mostly just ssh and copying stuff over
- Dr. Veras probably said it, but you might want to just have a native linux system, it's what I did and it was much simpler

## C/Make/Linux Review Session

I've reserved DEH Large Team Room 245 for if you would like to come in person, but there is also a zoom link below. As well, if you are wanting to come, but are unable to attend we will post a recording.
